# Money Growth and Inflation
I explored key relationships in money, banking, and macroeconomics. For more detail, see [here](https://github.com/kshao19/Money-Growth-and-Inflation-A-Data-Exploration).

For instance, I visualized the relationship between real and nominal GDP and the Portfolio Choice Theory assuming that as wealth increases, investors have more resources to purchase assets, therefore, their demand for money increases.

# Time Series Econometrics: AR(1) and ARCH-M

I constructed a Monte Carlo simulation of an AR(1) process in Python and estimated an ARCH-M model in R to analyze excess returns on 6-month Treasury bills.
