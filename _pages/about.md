Welcome! My name is Kailai. I am born and raised in Shanghai, China and a proud alumna of [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) (2018-2022). I am currently working at NERA Economic Consulting in New York City, US., specializing in antitrust research in mergers and acquisitons. 

My research interest is in industrial organization and labor economics. Besides that, I enjoy doing hot yoga, hiking, and cooking.
