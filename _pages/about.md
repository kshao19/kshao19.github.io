Welcome! My name is Kailai. I was born and raised in Shanghai, China, and am a proud alumna of [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) (2018-2022). I am currently working at the NERA Economic Consulting in New York City, US, specializing in antitrust research in mergers and acquisitions. 

I am interested in industrial organization, quantitative marketing, and labor economics. Outside research, I enjoy yoga, hiking, and cooking.
