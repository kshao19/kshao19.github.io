## Cross-Platform Demand, Market Power, and the Disney–Fox Merger
*Working Paper, 2025*
**[[Paper]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jH2somiAm-a2t6zdhhaXv3rddAQSC7Vq/view?usp=drive_link)** **[[Code]](https://github.com/kshao19/Analyzing-Cross-Platform-Demand/blob/main/code_for_disney_%26_fox_merger_(substitution_effect).py)**

> This paper analyzes U.S. theatrical demand from 2000–2024 using a nested logit model to evaluate the Disney–Fox merger and the rise of streaming platforms. I find no evidence that the merger increased Disney/Fox’s theatrical market power, while streaming services, especially Disney+, significantly diverted demand away from theatres. The results show that cross-platform ecosystems, not horizontal consolidation, now shape competitive outcomes in media markets.
