## Cross-Platform Demand, Market Power, and the Disney–Fox Merger
*Working Paper, 2025*
**[[Paper]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jH2somiAm-a2t6zdhhaXv3rddAQSC7Vq/view?usp=drive_link)** **[[Code]](https://github.com/kshao19/Analyzing-Cross-Platform-Demand/blob/main/code_for_disney_%26_fox_merger_(substitution_effect).py)**

> This paper analyzes U.S. theatrical demand from 2000–2024 using a nested logit model to evaluate the Disney–Fox merger and the rise of streaming platforms. I find no evidence that the merger increased Disney/Fox’s theatrical market power, while streaming services, especially Disney+, significantly diverted demand away from theatres. The results show that cross-platform integration, in addition to horizontal consolidation, now shape competitive outcomes in interconnected media markets.

## Immigrants’ Access to Credit and Labor Market Outcomes
*Work in Progress with Esteban Argudo, 2025*
**[[Overview]](https://github.com/kshao19/immigrant-labor-and-credit-search/tree/main)** **[[Code]](https://github.com/kshao19/immigrant-labor-and-credit-search/blob/main/VFI%20and%20Simulation.py)**

> In this project, I built a dynamic labor and credit search model to explain why immigrants face lower wages, and how changes in credit access will affect their wages, employments, and search time. I solved the Bellman equations using value function iteractions and calibrated it to match the observed differences in wage, employment, and unsecure debt holdings between natives and immigrants in the U.S. according to the SIPP data.
